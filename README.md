# kubelogin [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/int128/kubelogin.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/int128/kubelogin) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/int128/kubelogin)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/int128/kubelogin)

This is a kubectl plugin for [Kubernetes OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens), also known as `kubectl oidc-login`.

In Kubernetes OIDC authentication, kubectl does not provide actual authentication and we need to manually set an ID token and refresh token to the kubeconfig.
Kubelogin provides browser based authentication and writes an ID token and refresh token to the kubeconfig.


## Getting Started

You can install the latest release from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [Krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin/releases) as follows:

```sh
# Homebrew
brew tap int128/kubelogin
brew install kubelogin

# Krew
kubectl krew install oidc-login

# GitHub Releases
curl -LO https://github.com/int128/kubelogin/releases/download/v1.12.0/kubelogin_linux_amd64.zip
unzip kubelogin_linux_amd64.zip
ln -s kubelogin kubectl-oidc_login
```

You need to configure the OIDC provider, Kubernetes API server, kubectl authentication and role binding.
See the following documents for more:

- [Getting Started with Keycloak](docs/keycloak.md)
- [Getting Started with Google Identity Platform](docs/google.md)
- [Team Operation](docs/team_ops.md)


### Login by the command

Just run the command:

```sh
kubelogin

# or run as a kubectl plugin
kubectl oidc-login
```

It automatically opens the browser and you can log in to the provider.

After authentication, it writes an ID token and refresh token to the kubeconfig.

```
% kubelogin
Open http://localhost:8000 for authentication
You got a valid token until 2019-05-18 10:28:51 +0900 JST
Updated ~/.kubeconfig
```

Now you can access to the cluster.

```
% kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echoserver-86c78fdccd-nzmd5   1/1     Running   0          26d
```

If the ID token is valid, kubelogin does nothing.

```
% kubelogin
You already have a valid token until 2019-05-18 10:28:51 +0900 JST
```

If the ID token has expired, kubelogin will refresh the token using the refresh token in the kubeconfig.
If the refresh token has expired, kubelogin will proceed the authentication.


### Wrap kubectl and login transparently

You can wrap kubectl to transparently login to the provider.

```sh
alias kubectl='kubelogin exec -- kubectl'

# or run as a kubectl plugin
alias kubectl='kubectl oidc-login exec -- kubectl'
```

If the token expired, it updates the kubeconfig and executes kubectl.

```
% kubectl get pods
Open http://localhost:8000 for authentication
You got a valid token until 2019-06-05 19:05:34 +0900 JST
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echoserver-86c78fdccd-nzmd5   1/1     Running   0          26d
```

If the ID token is valid, it just executes kubectl.

```
% kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echoserver-86c78fdccd-nzmd5   1/1     Running   0          26d
```

If the ID token has expired, kubelogin will refresh the token using the refresh token in the kubeconfig.
If the refresh token has expired, kubelogin will proceed the authentication.

Kubelogin respects kubectl options passed to the extra arguments.
For example, if you run `kubectl --kubeconfig .kubeconfig`,
it will update `.kubeconfig` and execute kubectl.

If the current auth provider is not `oidc`, it just executes kubectl.


## Configuration

This document is for the development version.
If you are looking for a specific version, see [the release tags](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin/tags).

Kubelogin supports the following options:

```
Usage:
  kubelogin [flags]
  kubelogin [command]

Examples:
  # Login to the provider using authorization code grant.
  kubelogin

  # Login to the provider using resource owner password credentials grant.
  kubelogin --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD

  # Wrap kubectl and login transparently
  alias kubectl='kubelogin exec -- kubectl'

Available Commands:
  exec        Login transparently and execute the kubectl command
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the version information

Flags:
      --kubeconfig string              Path to the kubeconfig file
      --context string                 The name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --user string                    The name of the kubeconfig user to use. Prior to --context
      --certificate-authority string   Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify       If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
  -v, --v int                          If set to 1 or greater, it shows debug log
      --listen-port ints               Port to bind to the local server. If multiple ports are given, it will try the ports in order (default [8000,18000])
      --skip-open-browser              If true, it does not open the browser on authentication
      --username string                If set, perform the resource owner password credentials grant
      --password string                If set, use the password instead of asking it
  -h, --help                           help for kubelogin
```

It supports the following keys of `auth-provider` in a kubeconfig.
See [kubectl authentication](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#using-kubectl) for more.

Key | Direction | Value
----|-----------|------
`idp-issuer-url`                  | Read (Mandatory) | Issuer URL of the provider.
`client-id`                       | Read (Mandatory) | Client ID of the provider.
`client-secret`                   | Read (Mandatory) | Client Secret of the provider.
`idp-certificate-authority`       | Read | CA certificate path of the provider.
`idp-certificate-authority-data`  | Read | Base64 encoded CA certificate of the provider.
`extra-scopes`                    | Read | Scopes to request to the provider (comma separated).
`id-token`                        | Write | ID token got from the provider.
`refresh-token`                   | Write | Refresh token got from the provider.


### Kubeconfig

You can set path to the kubeconfig file by the option or the environment variable just like kubectl.
It defaults to `~/.kube/config`.

```sh
# by the option
kubelogin --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig

# by the environment variable
KUBECONFIG="/path/to/kubeconfig1:/path/to/kubeconfig2" kubelogin
```

If you set multiple files, kubelogin will find the file which has the current authentication (i.e. `user` and `auth-provider`) and write a token to it.


### Authentication flows

#### Authorization code flow

Kubelogin performs the authorization code flow by default.

It starts the local server at port 8000 or 18000 by default.
You need to register the following redirect URIs to the provider:

- `http://localhost:8000`
- `http://localhost:18000` (used if port 8000 is already in use)

You can change the ports by the option:

```sh
kubelogin --listen-port 12345 --listen-port 23456
```


#### Resource owner password credentials grant flow

As well as you can use the resource owner password credentials grant flow.
Keycloak supports this flow but you need to explicitly enable the "Direct Access Grants" feature in the client settings.
Most OIDC providers do not support this flow.

You can pass the username and password:

```
% kubelogin --username USER --password PASS
```

or use the password prompt:

```
% kubelogin --username USER
Password:
```


### Extra scopes

You can set the extra scopes to request to the provider by `extra-scopes` in the kubeconfig.

```sh
kubectl config set-credentials keycloak --auth-provider-arg extra-scopes=email
```

Currently kubectl does not accept multiple scopes, so you need to edit the kubeconfig as like:

```sh
kubectl config set-credentials keycloak --auth-provider-arg extra-scopes=SCOPES
sed -i '' -e s/SCOPES/email,profile/ $KUBECONFIG
```


### CA Certificates

You can use your self-signed certificates for the provider.

```sh
kubectl config set-credentials keycloak \
  --auth-provider-arg idp-certificate-authority=$HOME/.kube/keycloak-ca.pem
```


### HTTP Proxy

You can set the following environment variables if you are behind a proxy: `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`.
See also [net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment).
